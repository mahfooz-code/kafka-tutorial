# Confluent Kafka

Confluent Kafka is a distribution of Apache Kafka by Confluent that provides additional features such as enhanced tools, connectors, and management capabilities.

The `confluent-kafka` Python library is a popular Kafka client for Python applications.

It is based on `librdkafka` and is highly performant.

## Key Concepts

1. **Producer** : Sends messages to Kafka topics.
2. **Consumer** : Reads messages from Kafka topics.
3. **Topics** : Named destinations for messages in Kafka.
4. **Brokers** : Kafka servers that manage and store messages.
5. **Schema Registry** (optional): Manages Avro schemas for message serialization and deserialization.

Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that can be used to manage real-time data pipelines for deep learning applications. The steps to integrate Kafka with deep learning typically involve:

### **1. Data Ingestion & Streaming**

- Set up **Kafka producers** to ingest raw data (e.g., sensor data, logs, images, or video streams).
- Stream data from sources like IoT devices, databases, or APIs into Kafka topics.
- Apply preprocessing, such as filtering or transformation, before pushing data to Kafka.

### **2. Data Processing & Transformation**

- Use **Kafka Streams** or **Apache Flink** to process data in real-time.
- Perform transformations like feature extraction, normalization, or data augmentation.
- Convert raw data (e.g., text, images) into a format suitable for deep learning models.

### **3. Model Training**

- Consume preprocessed data from Kafka topics using a deep learning framework like **TensorFlow** , **PyTorch** , or **Keras** .
- Store training data in a **distributed file system** (e.g., HDFS, S3) or a database.
- Train models in batch or real-time using streaming data.

### **4. Model Deployment & Inference**

- Deploy trained models as microservices (e.g., using Flask, FastAPI, or TensorFlow Serving).
- Use Kafka consumers to fetch real-time data for inference.
- Send model predictions back to Kafka topics for further use.

### **5. Monitoring & Feedback Loop**

- Capture model performance metrics (latency, accuracy, drift detection).
- Implement an automated feedback loop to retrain models with new data.
- Use Kafka for logging and monitoring model behavior.

### **1. Introduction to Event Streaming (Week 1-2)**

- **Objective** : Understand the role of event streaming in modern architectures.

- **Resources** :
- [Apache Kafka Documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)
- Book: "Kafka: The Definitive Guide" (Chapters 1-2).
- **Task** : Research and present a use case where Kafka shines.

### **2. Kafka Core Concepts & Setup (Week 3-4)**

- **Objective** : Grasp Kafka's architecture and perform basic setup.

- Installation (local, Docker), CLI commands (`kafka-topics`, `kafka-console-producer`).
- **Task** :
- Set up a single-node Kafka cluster.
- Create a topic, produce/consume messages via CLI.

### **3. Producers & Consumers Deep Dive (Week 5-6)**

- **Objective** : Configure efficient producers/consumers.
- **Topics** :
- Producer: acks, retries, idempotence, compression, serialization (Avro with Schema Registry).
- Consumer: offset management, rebalance listeners, consumer groups.
- Hands-on with Java/Python clients.
- **Task** :
- Build a producer with error handling and a consumer with manual offset control.

### **4. Kafka Internals (Week 7-8)**

- **Objective** : Understand Kafka's underlying mechanics.
- **Topics** :
- Log-structured storage, segment files, retention policies.
- Leader election, ISR (In-Sync Replicas), log compaction.
- Exactly-once semantics (EOS) and transactions.
- **Task** :
- Experiment with log retention settings and observe behavior.

### **5. Kafka Streams & KSQL (Week 9-10)**

- **Objective** : Implement stream processing.
- **Topics** :
- Kafka Streams API: DSL vs. Processor API, state stores, windowing.
- KSQL for stream processing with SQL.
- Joining streams, handling late data.
- **Task** :
- Build a real-time word counter using Kafka Streams.
- Use KSQL for aggregations on a clickstream dataset.

### **6. Kafka Connect & Ecosystem (Week 11-12)**

- **Objective** : Integrate Kafka with external systems.
- **Topics** :
- Source/Sink connectors (File, JDBC, Elasticsearch).
- Schema Registry, REST Proxy.
- Error handling and dead-letter queues.
- **Task** :
- Set up a JDBC connector to sync a database table with Kafka.

### **7. Security & Operations (Week 13-14)**

- **Objective** : Secure and monitor Kafka clusters.
- **Topics** :
- SSL/TLS, SASL (GSSAPI, PLAIN), ACLs.
- Monitoring with JMX, Prometheus, Grafana.
- Performance tuning (OS, JVM, broker settings).
- **Task** :
- Configure SSL encryption and SASL authentication on a cluster.

### **8. Advanced Scenarios & Projects (Week 15-16)**

- **Objective** : Tackle real-world challenges.
- **Topics** :
- Multi-cluster setups, geo-replication (MirrorMaker).
- Disaster recovery, capacity planning.
- Case studies (Netflix, Uber).
- **Project** :
- Design a fault-tolerant event-driven system for a ride-sharing app.

### **Resources & Community Engagement**
