While messages are opaque byte arrays to Kafka itself, it is recommended that additional structure, or schema, be imposed on the message content so that it can be easily understood. There are many options available for message schema, depending on your applicationâ€™s individual needs. 

Many Kafka developers favor the use of Apache Avro, which is a serialization framework originally developed for Hadoop. Avro provides a compact serialization format, schemas that are separate from the message payloads and that do not require code to be generated when they change, and strong data typing and schema evolution, with both backward and forward compatibility.
